# contact-app

#First you have to edit the backend/contactcontroller.js file,
Add your twilio account sid and authtoken there and add your twilio phone number. I have dropped comments where you have to make changes.

#Now you have to edit backend/contact-list.json file and add your contact there: Their name and twilio verified phone numbers.


#Now open CMD in backend and frontend/contact-app folders run command npm install
